							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-cog"></span>
									<h3>Introduction to Engineering Design (IED or ID)</h3>
									<p>A course that teaches problem-solving skills using a design development process. Models of product solutions are created, analyzed and communicated using solid modeling computer design software.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-wrench"></span>
									<h3>Principles of Engineering (POE)</h3>
									<p>A course that helps students understand the field of engineering/engineering technology. Exploring various technology systems and manufacturing processes help students learn how engineers and technicians use math, science and technology in an engineering problem solving process to benefit people. The course also includes concerns about social and political consequences of technological change. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-code"></span>
									<h3>Computer Science and Software Engineering (CSE)</h3>
									<p>CSE implements the College Board’s 2013 CS Principles framework. Using Python® as a primary tool and incorporating multiple platforms and languages for computation, this course aims to develop computational thinking, generate excitement about career paths that utilize computing, and introduce professional tools that foster creativity and collaboration. CSE helps students develop programming expertise and explore the workings of the Internet. Projects and problems include app development, visualization of data, cybersecurity, robotics, and simulation. The course aligns with CSTA 3B standards.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-archive"></span>
									<h3>Digital Electronics (DE)</h3>
									<p>A course in applied logic that encompasses the application of electronic circuits and devices. Computer simulation software is used to design and test digital circuitry prior to the actual construction of circuits and devices. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-university"></span>
									<h3>Civil Engineering and Architecture (CEA) </h3>
									<p>This course provides an overview of the fields of Civil Engineering and Architecture, while emphasizing the interrelationship and dependence of both fields on each other. Students use state of the art software to solve real world problems and communicate solutions to hands-on projects and activities. This course covers topics such as: Project Planning, Site Planning, Building Design, Project Documentation, and Presentation</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-desktop"></span>
									<h3>AP Computer Science A</h3>
									<p>This course emphasizes object oriented programming, algorithm development, and problem solving. The Java programming language
will be used to write programs. Students are expected to work at least 2-3 hrs. per week outside of class hours on their computers.
They will have access to school PCs. Students can also run and debug their programs on their personal computers. The computers
must be able to compile and run Java code.</p>
